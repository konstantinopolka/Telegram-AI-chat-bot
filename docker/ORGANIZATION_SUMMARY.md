# Docker Organization Summary

## What Was Done

### File Organization
- Moved `build.sh` and `deploy.sh` to `docker/` folder
- All Docker-related files are now centralized in `docker/` directory
- Updated script paths to work from the new location

### Current Docker Folder Structure
```
docker/
├── .env.docker          # Docker versioning configuration
├── Dockerfile           # Enhanced with build args and metadata
├── docker-compose.yml   # Updated with versioning support
├── database.env         # Database configuration
├── build.sh            # Automated build script with versioning
├── deploy.sh           # Registry deployment script  
├── examples.sh         # Usage examples and workflows
└── readme.md           # Comprehensive documentation
```

### Documentation Updates
- **docker/readme.md**: Complete rewrite with versioning system documentation
- **README.md**: Added Docker deployment section and updated project structure
- **examples.sh**: Created workflow examples for common operations

### Versioning System Features
- **Git-based versioning**: Automatic version detection from git tags/commits
- **Build metadata**: Embedded version, build date, and commit info
- **Container naming**: Version-aware container names
- **Image tagging**: Multiple tags (specific version, latest)
- **Registry support**: Automated push to Docker registries
- **Application integration**: Version info accessible in running bot

### Usage
From the `docker/` directory:
```bash
./build.sh              # Auto-version build
./build.sh 1.2.3        # Manual version
./deploy.sh 1.2.3       # Deploy to registry
./examples.sh           # Show usage examples
```

This setup provides a professional Docker versioning system similar to database migrations (Alembic) and source control (Git), making it easy to track, deploy, and rollback Docker builds.
