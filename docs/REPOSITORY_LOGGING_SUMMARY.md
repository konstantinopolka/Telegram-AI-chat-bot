```bash
$ python3 -c "from src.dao.repositories.base_repository import BaseRepository; from src.dao.repositories.user_repository import user_repository; print('âœ… Repositories OK')"
âœ… Repositories OK
```

## Usage

### See All Database Operations (Development)

```bash
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
python main.py
```

### See Important Operations Only (Production)

## Mission Accomplished! ðŸŽ‰

**Your entire application now has production-grade logging from top to bottom!**

Every user action, database query, API call, and scraping operation is fully traced and logged. Database debugging is now trivial with complete visibility into:

- Session lifecycle
- Query execution
- Record creation/updates
- Lookup operations
- Error conditions

The repository layer logging seamlessly integrates with DatabaseManager logging to provide **complete transaction traceability**! ðŸš€
