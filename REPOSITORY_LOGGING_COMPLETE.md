```

You'll see:

- Every database query
- Every session creation/close
- All result counts
- Full transaction lifecycle

### Production (Performance Monitoring)

```bash
export LOG_LEVEL=INFO
python main.py
```

You'll see:

- User registration/updates
- Article/review creation
- Telegraph publishing
- Admin status changes

### Production (Errors Only)

```bash
export LOG_LEVEL=ERROR
python main.py
```

You'll see:

- Database failures only
- Full stack traces
- Error context

## Integration with DatabaseManager

The repositories work seamlessly with DatabaseManager logging:

```log
# From DatabaseManager
DEBUG - Creating async database session
DEBUG - Async session created, yielding to caller

# From Repository
DEBUG - Fetching user by telegram_id: 123456789
DEBUG - Found user: @john_doe (telegram_id=123456789)

# Back to DatabaseManager
DEBUG - Committing async session
DEBUG - Async session committed successfully
DEBUG - Closing async session
```

**Complete transaction traceability!** üéâ

---

## Testing Recommendation

Run your application with DEBUG logging to verify:

```bash
# Set debug level
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Run the bot
python main.py

# Send a test message
# Check logs/bot.log for output
tail -f logs/bot.log
```

You should see initialization logs for all repositories followed by database operations as users interact with the bot.
